	The Great Outdoors
	</h4>
		<p>
		When I have time between contracts or on lieu time, I often can be found on a bike tour and camping on one of Newfoundland's Pennisula. On the weekends, I take to the East Coast Trail, a local sytem that stretches two thirds of the Avalon Penninsula. I enjoy going out for a hike with friends to have a boil-up, whale watch, or go trail running.

	Foraging Wild Foods
	</h4>
		<p>
		In my spare time I am a volunteer board member for the Foray Newfoundland and Labrador. I have volunteered with Foray NL since 2019 and my interests in mushrooms and lichen have grown each year. I enjoy walking in mossy woodlands in search of choice edibles mushrroms like the pictured belly-button hedgehogs and rare abroreal lichen species. Beyond foraging mushrooms, I enjoy foraging for other wild foods. Newfoundland has an array of delicious berries including; blueberries, partridgeberries, dewberries, arctic-plumboys, and cranberries. I also enjoy collecting seaside greens, such as; oyster-leaf, sea-pickle, lamb's quarters, scotch-lovage, and goose-tongue plantain!
