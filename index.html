			Hello, thank you for finding my webpage! My name is Gabby Riefesel and I am an ecologist and conservation biologist located in St. John's, Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada. My focal research interest include, nutrient cycling, spatial relationships between primary producers and consumers, and edge habitats with a partiular admiration for coastal  ecosystems.  </p>
			<p class = "profile"> Throughout my career, I have worked with several conservation based ENGO's including Nature Concervancy Canada, British Columbia Conservation Foundation, and the Whitehorse Fishladder and Hatchery. I am currently taking a break from work and I am embarking on the GIS Applications Specialist Program out of Fleming College.
